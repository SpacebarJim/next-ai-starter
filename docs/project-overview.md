# ðŸ”§ FORQ MVP UI SCREENS & WORKFLOW

---

NOTE: Users will be running the web app locally so assume that the server-side environment will be their own filesystem.

Use the src/lib/aiClient.ts file to make API calls to Claude.

## **1. Home Screen â€“ Project Entry Point**

### Purpose:

Initial hub to either start a new project or open an existing one. Mimics basic IDE behavior.

### Component Structure:

- **Title/Logo Header** (optional simple `h1`)
- **Two Primary Action Cards (side-by-side or stacked)**:
  - **Card 1: "Start New Project"**
    - Description: "Create a new AI-assisted app from a prompt."
    - Button: "Create New"
  - **Card 2: "Open Existing Project"**
    - Description: "Open and manage an existing Forq workspace."
    - Button: "Import Project" (uses browser's file input to import project JSON)

### Behavior:

- Clicking "Create New" routes to **New Project Setup Screen**
- Clicking "Import Project" opens file dialog to import a project file, then opens **Project Dashboard Screen**

---

## **2. New Project Setup Screen**

### Purpose:

Collects basic project metadata and runs the BRD â†’ PRD â†’ Tasks workflow.

### Component Structure:

---

## **3. Document Generation Progress Modal / Screen**

### Purpose:

Visual feedback while AI workflows run (BRD â†’ PRD â†’ Tasks).

### Component Structure:

- **State Machine UI (Three Stages)**:

  - Each box includes:
    - Status: Pending, Generating, Completed
    - View Button (if generated): opens preview modal
- **Loading Spinner or Progress Bar**
- **Status Text**
  - E.g., "Generating PRD...", "Waiting for AI agent..."

### Behavior:

- As each doc is generated, animate its box to show "completed."
- When all are complete â†’ auto-route to **Project Dashboard Screen**

---

## **4. Project Dashboard Screen (Kanban + Sidebar)**

Main interface after a project is initialized or loaded.

### Layout:

- **Sidebar (left column)**:

    - "Download Code" (generates zip of all code files)

- **Main Area: Kanban Board**

---

### Kanban Board View

**Pulled from current tasklist markdown (e.g., tasks_001.md)**

  - To-do (`[ ]`)
  - In-progress (`[-]`)
  - Done (`[x]`)
