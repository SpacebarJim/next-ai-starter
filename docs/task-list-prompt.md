You are a Senior Product Manager. Create a detailed list of one-story-point user stories based on the following Product Requirements Document (PRD).

<PRD GOES HERE>

Follow these steps:

1. **Epic & Feature Breakdown (User Story Mapping)**

   - Identify the major epics or features from the PRD.
   - Break each feature down into granular steps that can be completed in a single day or less.

2. **User Stories (INVEST Criteria)**

   - Write each user story following the INVEST model (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable).
   - Use the format: “As a [type of user], I want [action], so that [benefit].”

3. **Acceptance Criteria (Clear & Testable)**

   - Provide acceptance criteria for each user story, ensuring it is testable and unambiguous.
   - Example format: “Given [context], when [action], then [expected result].”

4. **Prioritization & Sequencing (WSJF or RICE)**

   - Apply a lightweight prioritization framework (e.g., Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF) or RICE) to order stories.
   - Include a brief explanation of priority rankings.

5. **Dependency Identification**

   - Note any inter-story or external dependencies.
   - Indicate if certain stories must be completed before others can start.

6. **Quality & Testing Considerations (Definition of Done)**

   - Outline a Definition of Done that includes code review, testing, and documentation updates.
   - Ensure each story can be accepted independently once its criteria are met.

7. **Roadmap Integration**
   - Map the final list of one-story-point stories into sprints or iterations.
   - Clarify how these stories align with the overall release timeline and milestones.

Produce a final, neatly categorized list of one-story-point user stories with acceptance criteria and priorities, ready for a development team to start work immediately. Create a very very very detailed markdown checklist of all of the stories for this project plan, with one-story-point tasks (with unchecked checkboxes) that break down each story. It is critically important that all of the details to implement this are in this list. Note that a very competent AI Coding Agent will be using this list to autonomously create this application, so be sure not to miss any details whatsoever, no matter how much time and thinking you must do to complete this very challenging but critically important task.
